# Randle

Just another Wordle variant. Here you will not know the
length of the word you are trying to guess. Only if you 
get every letter of the word you guessed correct, but 
the answer is longer, will you be told that the word 
is actually longer.

As the word can be any length there is no limit on how 
many guesses you can make. There is however a 
leaderboard that sorts primarily on how many guesses
you used to get the correct word. If two players get
the same amount of guesses the one with a longer word
goes above on the leaderboard. If the two players also
have the same word length, then the one with a shorter
time wins.
